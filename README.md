# Project 9

Project 9 involves the creation of a mobile application centered around capturing and storing a daily selfie. The app integrates Firebase storage for image storage, utilizes the CameraX library for capturing selfies, and employs Glide for seamless image display. Authentication has been implemented to ensure user privacy.

## Functionality 

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- Upon launching the app, a set of stored selfies from Firebase storage is displayed.
- Tapping on an image opens it in full-screen mode for closer inspection.
- Shaking the app triggers another fragment, opening the selfie camera for capturing a new image.
- Images are captured using CameraX library and uploaded to Firebase storage, and users are           seamlessly returned to the previous fragment.
- Authentication has been integrated to secure user data.

## Extensions

Potential extensions include:
- Enable social media sharing directly from the app.
- Implement a calendar view for organizing daily selfies.
- Add a reminder feature for daily selfie prompts.
